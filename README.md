Hello,

I am new to programming and are putting the theory into practice.

Within this simple programme I created a Matplotlib Line chart of the Bank of England Base Rate from August 2006 to June 2023.  I have included a Microsoft Excel file with the data.  The original data source can be found at https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/monetary-policy/baserate.xls 

Thank you.

Emma
